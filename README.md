# CRMDA Python Workgroup

This is the git repository for the KU CRMDA Python Workgroup. For more information, see http://crmda.ku.edu/workgroups.

Much of our work in the 2017-18 academic year is derived from Sinclair/Rockwell's excellent course, <a href="https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/master/ipynb/ArtOfLiteraryTextAnalysis.ipynb">The Art of Literary Text Analysis</a>. On this repository, you can find notebooks based on ALTA, with additional code and markdown added.
